Implementation of  various concepts of DiscreteMath

As of now, the current focus is to add all sorts of counting functions to the class Counting. I learn what's taught in maths class
supplemented by Discrete Mathematics and its Application by Kenneth H Rosen

I plan to add:  combinations, longest increasing and longest decreasing subsequence of the sequence,
                solution generator for x1 + x2 + ... = C where all variables are non negative integers
                listing of all permutations and combinations of the set {1, 2, 3... n} in lexographic order,
                listing of all permutations and combinations of a given set of natural numbers starting from one  
              : to the class Counting.
